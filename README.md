EncryptedNSUserDefaults
=======================

EncryptedNSUserDefaults provides more security to your default NSUserDefaults. Please **do not** use EncryptedNSUserDefaults to save vital information like user passwords. You should use KeyChainAccess instead.

At the moment the following types are supported:

NSString 
NSData
NSInteger
NSArray
NSMutableArray
NSDictionary
NSMutableDictionary
BOOL
double
float
int


Usage
=======================
Add  EncryptedNSUserDefaults.h and  EncryptedNSUserDefaultst.m files into your project and simply import EncryptedNSUserDefaults.h.

**Setting a key for decryption/encryption**
 
 It is recommended that you set a decryption/encryption key in your `-didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.
 ```
[EncryptedNSUserDefaults setKey:@"mySpecialKey"];
```

**Saving data**
```
    [EncryptedNSUserDefaults setString:@"OCG" forKey:@"string"];
    [EncryptedNSUserDefaults setInteger:100 forKey:@"int"];
    [EncryptedNSUserDefaults setBool:YES forKey:@"bool"];
```
**Retrieving data**
```
	NSString *str = [EncryptedNSUserDefaults stringForKey:@"string"];
    NSInteger int = [EncryptedNSUserDefaults integerForKey:@"int"];
    BOOL bool = [EncryptedNSUserDefaults boolForKey:@"bool"];
```

For more examples, check out the example project.




ToDo
=======================
Generating device specific keys so it will be useless if someone shares your .plist file.
